He held academic positions in English literature at both Magdalen College, Oxford (1925–1954), and Magdalene College, Cambridge (1954–1963). He is best known as the author of The Chronicles of Narnia, but he is also noted for his other works of fiction, such as The Screwtape Letters and The Space Trilogy, and for his non-fiction Christian apologetics, including Mere Christianity, Miracles, and The Problem of Pain.\\n\\nLewis was a close friend of J.\\xa0R.\\xa0R. Tolkien, author of The Lord of the Rings. Both men served on the English faculty at Oxford University and were active in the informal Oxford literary group known as the Inklings. According to Lewis\\'s 1955 memoir Surprised by Joy, he was baptized in the Church of Ireland but fell away from his faith during adolescence. Lewis returned to Anglicanism at the age of 32, owing to the influence of Tolkien and other friends, and he became an \"ordinary layman of the Church of England\". Lewis\\'s faith profoundly affected his work, and his wartime radio broadcasts on the subject of Christianity brought him wide acclaim.\\n\\nLewis wrote more than 30 books which have been translated into more than 30 languages and have sold millions of copies. The books that make up The Chronicles of Narnia have sold the most and have been popularized on stage, TV, radio, and cinema. His philosophical writings are widely cited by Christian scholars from many denominations.\\n\\nIn 1956, Lewis married American writer Joy Davidman; she died of cancer four years later at the age of 45. Lewis died on 22 November 1963 from kidney failure, at age 64. In 2013, on the 50th anniversary of his death, Lewis was honoured with a memorial in Poets\\' Corner in Westminster Abbey.\\n\\nLife\\n\\nChildhood\\n\\nClive Staples Lewis was born in Belfast in Ulster, Ireland (before partition), on 29 November 1898.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=1947, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.9332917332649231),\n",

He held academic positions in English literature at both Magdalen College, Oxford (1925–1954), and Magdalene College, Cambridge (1954–1963). He is best known as the author of The Chronicles of Narnia, but he is also noted for his other works of fiction, such as The Screwtape Letters and The Space Trilogy, and for his non-fiction Christian apologetics, including Mere Christianity, Miracles, and The Problem of Pain.\\n\\nLewis was a close friend of J.\\xa0R.\\xa0R. Tolkien, author of The Lord of the Rings. Both men served on the English faculty at Oxford University and were active in the informal Oxford literary group known as the Inklings. According to Lewis\\'s 1955 memoir Surprised by Joy, he was baptized in the Church of Ireland but fell away from his faith during adolescence. Lewis returned to Anglicanism at the age of 32, owing to the influence of Tolkien and other friends, and he became an \"ordinary layman of the Church of England\". Lewis\\'s faith profoundly affected his work, and his wartime radio broadcasts on the subject of Christianity brought him wide acclaim.\\n\\nLewis wrote more than 30 books which have been translated into more than 30 languages and have sold millions of copies. The books that make up The Chronicles of Narnia have sold the most and have been popularized on stage, TV, radio, and cinema. His philosophical writings are widely cited by Christian scholars from many denominations.\\n\\nIn 1956, Lewis married American writer Joy Davidman; she died of cancer four years later at the age of 45. Lewis died on 22 November 1963 from kidney failure, at age 64. In 2013, on the 50th anniversary of his death, Lewis was honoured with a memorial in Poets\\' Corner in Westminster Abbey.\\n\\nLife\\n\\nChildhood\\n\\nClive Staples Lewis was born in Belfast in Ulster, Ireland (before partition), on 29 November 1898.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=1947, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.9332917332649231), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='9e488253-f469-448a-8d21-174814d2244f', embedding=None, metadata={'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.%20M.%20Barrie', 'title': 'J.

The Liebers\\' brewery closed down in 1921 after the advent of prohibition. When the Great Depression hit, few people could afford to build, causing clients at Kurt Sr.\\'s architectural firm to become scarce. Vonnegut\\'s brother and sister had finished their primary and secondary educations in private schools, but Vonnegut was placed in a public school called Public School No.\\xa043 (now the James Whitcomb Riley School). He was bothered by the Great Depression, and both his parents were affected deeply by their economic misfortune. His father withdrew from normal life and became what Vonnegut called a \"dreamy artist\". His mother became depressed, withdrawn, bitter, and abusive. She labored to regain the family\\'s wealth and status, and Vonnegut said that she expressed hatred for her husband that was \"as corrosive as hydrochloric acid\". She often tried in vain to sell short stories she had written to Collier\\'s, The Saturday Evening Post, and other magazines.\\n\\nHigh school and Cornell University \\n\\nVonnegut enrolled at Shortridge High School in Indianapolis in 1936. While there, he played clarinet in the school band and became a co-editor (along with Madelyn Pugh) for the Tuesday edition of the school newspaper, The Shortridge Echo. Vonnegut said that his tenure with the Echo allowed him to write for a large audience—his fellow students—rather than for a teacher, an experience, he said, was \"fun and easy\". \"It just turned out that I could write better than a lot of other people\", Vonnegut observed. \"Each person has something he can do easily and can\\'t imagine why everybody else has so much trouble doing it.\"\\n\\nAfter graduating from Shortridge in 1940, Vonnegut enrolled at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. He wanted to study the humanities and had aspirations of becoming an architect like his father, but his father and brother Bernard, an atmospheric scientist, urged him to study a \"useful\" discipline.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=3827, end_char_idx=5997, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=1.0959757566452026)], metadata={'fbc13228-b4d6-4a6c-9b2a-c5f484ac10c5': {'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C.%20S.%20Lewis', 'title': 'C.

He is also known for the superhero film Doctor Strange (2016), based on the Marvel Comics character.\\n\\nEarly life\\nScott Derrickson grew up in Denver, Colorado. He graduated from Biola University with a B.A. in Humanities with an emphasis in philosophy and literature and a B.A. in communications with an emphasis in film and a minor in theology. He completed his graduate studies at USC School of Cinema-Television.\\n\\nCareer \\nDerrickson\\'s debut feature was Hellraiser: Inferno, the fifth installment in the long-running Hellraiser film series. It was released straight to video in 2000. Following this, Derrickson and co-writer Paul Harris Boardman spent several years doing script-doctoring work for studios. \"I was paid to write or rewrite 13 screenplays,\" Derrickson said, \"None of them got made. I was earning a good living but all of my creativity would be read by just a handful of executives. It caused a kind of soul sickness in me.\" In 2004, he conceived the story for Land of Plenty for German director Wim Wenders.\\n\\nDerrickson co-wrote and directed The Exorcism of Emily Rose, which was loosely based on a true story about Anneliese Michel. The film won the 2005 Saturn Award for Best Horror or Thriller Film and in 2006 was named in the Chicago Film Critics Association\\'s list of the \"Top 100 Scariest Films Ever Made.\" Theatrical box office gross for The Exorcism of Emily Rose was over $144 million worldwide. It received the award for Best Horror Film at the 32nd Saturn Awards.\\n\\nDerrickson next directed a remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still, starring Keanu Reeves and Jennifer Connelly, written by David Scarpa.

In the 1960s and 1970s, he moved towards sexploitation and pornographic films such as The Sinister Urge (1960), Orgy of the Dead (1965) and Necromania (1971), and wrote over 80 lurid pulp crime and sex novels.\\n\\nNotable for their campy aesthetics, technical errors, unsophisticated special effects, use of poorly-matched stock footage, eccentric casts, idiosyncratic stories and non sequitur dialogue, Wood's films remained largely obscure until he was posthumously awarded a Golden Turkey Award for Worst Director of All Time in 1980, renewing public interest in his life and work.\\n\\nFollowing the publication of Rudolph Grey's 1992 oral biography Nightmare of Ecstasy: The Life and Art of Edward D. Wood Jr., a biopic of his life, Ed Wood (1994), was directed by Tim Burton. Starring Johnny Depp as Wood and Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi, the film received critical acclaim and various awards, including two Academy Awards.\\n\\nEarly years\\nWood's father, Edward Sr., worked for the United States Post Office as a custodian, and his family relocated numerous times around the United States. Eventually, they settled in Poughkeepsie, New York, where Ed Wood Jr. was born in 1924. According to his second wife, Kathy O'Hara, Wood's mother Lillian would dress him in girl's clothing when he was a child because she had always wanted a daughter (Wood had one brother, several years younger than himself).

      "\u001b[0m\u001b[1;3;38;2;90;149;237m[wiki_search_engine] A: The Sponsorship Scandal was a political scandal in Canada involving the misappropriation of government funds intended for promoting national unity in Quebec. The Government of Canada, specifically under Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, was involved in the scandal through the mismanagement and misuse of funds allocated for the sponsorship program. The scandal led to a significant loss of public support for the governing Liberals and raised questions about accountability and transparency in government spending.\n",
      "\u001b[0m\u001b[1;3;38;2;11;159;203m[wiki_search_engine] A: The key events of the Sponsorship Scandal in Quebec included the Gomery Commission's public hearings that began in September 2004 in Ottawa, where top officials testified about the mismanagement of the sponsorship program. The inquiry revealed that advertising firms submitted false invoices, made cash contributions to the Liberal Party of Canada's Quebec wing, and put Liberal workers on their payrolls. The scandal led to Prime Ministers Jean Chrétien and Paul Martin testifying in February 2005, with Chrétien defending the program's importance in raising federal visibility in Quebec. The Phase I Report released in November 2005 criticized Chrétien's chief of staff and cleared Martin of direct involvement in kickback schemes. The Phase II Report in February 2006 provided recommendations for changes to the civil service and government relations. The scandal resulted in a sharp decline in support for the governing Liberals and led to calls for increased transparency and accountability in government operations.\n",

      "\u001b[0m\u001b[1;3;38;2;237;90;200m[wiki_search_engine] A: Sigmund Freud was an Austrian neurologist who founded psychoanalysis, a clinical method for evaluating and treating pathologies believed to stem from conflicts in the psyche. He was born in 1856 to Galician Jewish parents in the Austrian Empire. Freud qualified as a doctor of medicine in 1881 and established his clinical practice in Vienna in 1886. He developed therapeutic techniques like free association and discovered transference, emphasizing the role of the unconscious in mental processes. Freud's work redefined sexuality, introduced the Oedipus complex, and proposed a model of psychic structure comprising id, ego, and super-ego.

He began parachute training but fractured a fibula during an exercise. Waugh then took unpaid leave to write his novel \"Brideshead Revisited: The Sacred & Profane Memories of Captain Charles Ryder,\" which marked the beginning of his explicitly Catholic novels. He later served in the Maclean Mission to Yugoslavia, where he expressed concerns about the welfare of the Catholic Church in Croatia. Despite his dislike for the Communist-led Partisans and Tito, his report on \"Church and State in Liberated Croatia\" was suppressed by the Foreign Office to maintain good relations with Tito.\n",

The air station had three red brick hangars and eight paved runways, with the longest runway being 3,550 feet in length. Initially used for fixed-wing operations, the air station later became primarily focused on rotary-wing operations, serving as an intermediate and advanced training site for rotary-wing Naval Aviators from the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard. The base ceased helicopter training operations in December 1973 and was eventually closed, later becoming the Ellyson Industrial Park.\n",

It served as an auxiliary facility to Chevalier Field at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida. The air station had three red brick hangars and eight paved runways, with the longest runway being 3,550 feet in length. Over time, the short length of the runways became incompatible with newer, higher performance aircraft, leading to a shift in operations. By December 1973, conflicts with air traffic patterns and the reorganization of Naval Air Training Command led to the decision to close the airfield for flight operations, with helicopter training moving to NAS Whiting Field, Florida.\n",

It is a prestigious five-star rank with NATO code OF-10, equivalent to the ranks of Admiral of the Fleet in the Royal Navy and Marshal of the Royal Air Force in the Royal Air Force. Throughout history, the rank of Field Marshal has been used sporadically and was vacant during certain periods in the 18th and 19th centuries. It has been a tradition for Field Marshals to remain officers for life, though on half-pay when not in an appointment or retired. After World War II, it became customary to appoint the Chief of the General Staff to the rank on their last day in the post. In total, 141 individuals have held the rank of Field Marshal, with the majority having risen through the ranks of the British Army or the colonial British Indian Army to achieve this prestigious position.\n",

I really didn\\'t know what was going on or who I was anymore. Adopting another name helped me open up an avenue to get back.\"\\n\\nEbert began initial writing and recording completely alone, doing \"the horn lines with [his] mouth or a kazoo on the demos\" and \"all the background vocals layering\\xa0... pretending that there were people there.\" After meeting singer Jade Castrinos outside a Los Angeles cafe, Ebert and Castrinos started writing music together, and became a part of the art and music collective The Masses, which was partially started by some seed money from actor Heath Ledger. Their fledgling group eventually swelled to more than ten members, some of whom had been Ebert\\'s friends since he was young. In mid-2009, Ebert, Castrinos, and a group of musicians toured the country by bus as Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros. The first show they played in 2009 was at the Marfa Film Festival in Marfa, Texas. The band recorded their debut album, Up from Below, in Laurel Canyon. Produced by Nicolo Aglietti and Aaron Older, it was released on July 14, 2009. Up from Below is also the name of one of the songs in this album, in which Ebert states \"I was only five/when my dad told me I\\'d die/I cried as he said son/ was nothing could be done\". Says Ebert, \"My dad would be doing therapy in his office upstairs and I\\'d hear screamings, because they\\'d be role-playing and he\\'d be acting as his patient\\'s father and they\\'d get upset and hit him and all this stuff.

They had no access to running water, showers, toilets or hygiene products.\\n\\nThe case has been described by Detective Chief Inspector Peter Yeomans as \"like nothing I\\'ve ever seen,\" and was considered by many to be so shocking that, in a rare move, the New South Wales Children\\'s Court allowed full details to be made public, albeit with all names changed to pseudonyms for the children\\'s protection, including the family name of \"Colt.\"\\n\\nRelations with outsiders \\nAfter the death of June in 2001 and Tim in 2009, the family was led by Betty Colt. Betty and her younger brother, Charlie, had twelve children together. The family received multiple welfare payments, including disability and family support.\\n\\nStarting from the 1990s, the family was known to frequently relocate between South Australia, Western Australia, and Victoria before locals became suspicious of their activities. They relocated to New South Wales, thirty kilometers (20 miles) outside of the small town of Boorowa, three and a half hours southwest of Sydney. The police ultimately discovered nearly forty members of the family living under squalid conditions in tents and shacks. They sometimes performed as a musical band that was originally formed by Tim.\\n\\nInvestigation\\n\\nDiscovery of the case \\nKnowledge of the family came to authorities in June 2010, which led to seven \"risk of significant harm\" reports. However, an official investigation was not opened until July 2012 when a child reported overhearing another child at a local primary school speaking of an unkempt girl, living in the bush, who was pregnant with a child fathered by a brother. The child overheard the girl state that one of her sisters was pregnant and they did not know which of her brothers was the father.\\n\\nPolice and welfare services involvement \\nOver the next year, police tracked the family down and, after obtaining an understanding of the living conditions in the family\\'s encampment, put several children in foster care, including Bobby (Betty\\'s son with her younger brother) and Billy (Betty\\'s son with her older son). Police discovered the living area of thirty-eight members of the family in the bush, living under squalid conditions in tents and shacks, on the outskirts of Boorowa.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=1839, end_char_idx=4158, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.9427542686462402)], metadata={'00ba2020-40ad-4abf-93f2-64b5fa7b60bb': {'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward%20Sharpe%20and%20the%20Magnetic%20Zeros', 'title': 'Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros'}, 'ca84caf1-f6ff-42c6-bb86-8746494f94fe': {'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt%20clan%20incest%20case', 'title': 'Colt clan incest case'}})"
